The project was excitingly challenging but non the less feel confident about my web application:

I created the HTML documents one a Home/About me page, my portfolio page, and also my contact page with a request for users social media handles as well as my own personal social media pages inluding facebook linked in and instagram

Each page is resposive like required as well as having an active nav bar that links the three pages to each other

Used the bootstrap components on all three pages as well as using the containers with rows and columns takingh up the page
