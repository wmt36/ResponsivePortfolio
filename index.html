        <p> My name is William Malcolm Tutein, I was born and raised on the tiny island of St. Croix, located in the United States Virgin Islands. My parents John and Kendall Tutein got married in 1986, Seven years and two baby boys later the third charm of the Tutein family came to life on Feburary 12, 1993. Growing up under the guidance of my parents and my two older brothers Sean and Daniel, has been one of the greatest blessing I could have ever asked for. With a combination of my family and my cultures influence on me, it has instlled another level of determination, confidence, as well as faith in my ability to create a positive sitation in any circumstance.

        <p> When I was turning 18 my parents allowed me the opportunity to move to Cheyenne Wyoming to live with, who are now my beloved guardians Tim and Bonnie Woodard.  Moving away from home as a teenager is not as easy as you think, and it would have been a lot harder if my best friends didn't move up with me as well. At first Du’Ryan, Sammy, Sameer, and I were just teammates on our high-school football team, but surly enough that relationship evolved into a brotherhood! You’re probably thinking how does four teenagers from St. Croix end up in the middle of Wyoming? The answer to that is our high school football coach Jason Woodard, the son of our guardians, who I am forever grateful for! His belief in our ability to play the game of football on the state side level gave our parents more trust for our transition to the states to be smoother.

        <p>While in Wyoming we took advantage of the oppurtunity and over came adversities such as not being able to play football our senior year of high-school. Although this was the first it wasn’t the last and what seemed to be detrimental, in the grand scheme of things it was minor set back to what became a major comeback. With my determination and faith three years later I was starting on the Devision 1 level at the University of Wyoming. My freshman year I was asked not to comeback to my division 2 football team. During my sophomore year I worked 40 hours a week, took 21 credit hours during the fall, and  19 credit hours spring, just to get the chance to walk on to the University of Wyoming football team that following summer. Once I joined the team, I knew it was all gas no breaks from there! Playing fort he Wyoming Cowboys has been one of my proudest accomplishments, and what made playing there even better was because of my brothers Du’ryan and Ethan whom I had as teammates and roommates throughout our duration on the team. Du’ryan was the reason for our willingness to take our talents to Cowboys. And I wouldn’t trade those years for anything else.

        <p>During my first year on the team I was able to work my way from fifth string Strong Safety to second string by the start of the season, and slowly worked my way to starter by the sixth game of the season. Although I became a starter I still wasn’t awarded a scholarship, so I was still working 20 hours a week going to school full-time and playing football. Due to juggling all of that and the denial of my scholarship, and the end of the following seaseon my dream was cut short and I was cut from the team. With confusion going through my mind, my faith and determination to not give up led me to grad school where I acquired my Masters in Sports and Exercise Psychology. This accomplishment proved to me that I was able to accomplish anything I set my mind to.  As a child I challenged my future self to start on a Division 1 football and acquire a Masters Degree. I can say I have successfully done both, so with that being the case I realized that through faith and determination success in imminant.
